MSU Data Analytics BootCamp Module 4 Challenge

Code file name: PyCitySchools.ipynp located in the subdirectory PyCitySchools 

This PANDAS worksheet performs the following functions:

It reads in and merges two CSV files located in the 'Resources' subdirectory of the repository and performs various descript statistical summaries of schools within a school district. It prints the output of the script to the terminal window and to a text file placed into a directory called 'analysis'. Specifically, the script will determine the number of months tracked in the data, the total amount of profit or loss over the course of the tracked time, the average month to month profit/loss over the time tracked, and the month to month values that showed the greatest profit/loss (and in which months they occured).

Code sourcing statement
I did use a natural language description of the desired script's functions entered into ChatGPT 3.5 to help build the code structure. I did copy pieces of that code in order to be more efficient, but I tailored it to fit all of the desired functions of this paricular project. I did not directly copy and paste any of this code from the internet otherwise (e.g., from StackExchange or any other webpage). I did not seek any assistance or use code written by my peers or instructors for this challenge.

End of code sourcing statement.
