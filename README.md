# pandas-challenge
MSU Data Analytics BootCamp Module 4 Challenge

Code file name: PyCitySchools.ipynp located in the subdirectory PyCitySchools 

This PANDAS worksheet performs the following functions:

It reads in and merges two CSV files containing data relating to schools within a single school district and student performance winthin each of those schools. The CSV files are located in the 'Resources' subdirectory of the 'PyCitySchools' directory of the repository. One CSV is a list of every student in the district and their educational performance. Once it reads and merges the CSVs, the PANDAS code performs various descriptive statistical summaries of schools within the school district, including their size, their type, their budgets (both overall and per capita), how well the students are performing in both reading and math individually, and how many students are passing reading and math overall. It prints the output of the analyses directly to the page when executed within Jupyter Notebook. It also contains a short overall summary of the data and a handful of takeaways that can be gleaned from the data analysis. The Jupyter Notebook has not been executed and must be run in order to see all of the analyses.

*Code sourcing statement*
-----------------------

I did use a natural language description of some desired code functions entered into ChatGPT 3.5 to help build the code structure. I did copy pieces of that code in order to be more efficient, but I tailored it to fit all of the desired functions of this paricular project. I did not directly copy and paste any of this code from the internet otherwise (e.g., from StackExchange or any other webpage). I did not seek any assistance or use code written by my peers or instructors for this challenge.

End of code sourcing statement.
